# This file is for tweaking various values within the Birdfeeder application.
# Tweaking isn't typically necessary for most set-ups, but it's here 
# if needed! 

# The list of thresholds below corresponds to the species in the TensorFlow model.  
# The first number is the relative sensitivity for the specific species.  1.0 is 
# normal sensitivity.  Higher values are higher sensitivity, higher likelihood 
# of detection, lower values are lower likelihood of detection. 
# The 2nd value is where within the image you want to detect:
# [min_width, max_width, min_height, max_height]
# The origin is in the upper leftmost corner.  
# For example, if you only wanted to detect the species in the right half of
# the image, you'd use [0.5, 1.0, 0, 1.0], left half would be [0, 0.5, 0, 1.0].  
# If you only wanted to detect the species in the bottom half of he image you'd use 
# [0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0], top half would be [0, 1.0, 0, 0.5], etc.
